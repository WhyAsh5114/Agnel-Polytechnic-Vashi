			The founder of Agnel ashram, Fr. C. Rodrigues was a great visionary. His vision was to foster
			love and understanding among the various communities in India and to contribute to the
			development of self-reliance among the youth through education.
			<br />
			<br />
			Agnel Polytechnic in Vashi, Navi Mumbai, was started in 1983 with only one program - Diploma in
			civil engineering. It has grown since then, and today we have four branches of study in the polytechnic
			- Diploma in Civil Engineering, Dip. in Mechanical Engineering, Dip. in Automobile engineering
			and Dip. in Electronics and Telecommunication.
			<br />
			<br />
			What makes Agnel Polytechnic a unique institution in Mumbai is its discipline and culture and the
			dedication of the faculty in imparting knowledge and expertise to the students in a cosmopolitan
			atmosphere.
