	<p class="text-lg  ml-32 mr-32">
		The founder of Agnel ashram, Fr. C. Rodrigues was a great visionary. His vision was to foster
		love and understanding among the various communities in India and to contribute to the
		development of self-reliance among the youth through education.
		<br />
        <br />
		Agnel Polytechnic in Vashi, Navi Mumbai, was started in 1983 with only one program – Diploma in civil
		engineering. It has grown since then, and today we have four branches of study in the polytechnic
		– Diploma in Civil Engineering, Dip. in Mechanical Engineering, Dip. in Automobile engineering and
		Dip. in Electronics and Telecommunication.
		<br />
        <br />
		What makes Agnel Polytechnic a unique institution in Mumbai is its discipline and culture and the
		dedication of the faculty in imparting knowledge and expertise to the students in a cosmopolitan
		atmosphere.
