			<p class="py-6 font-semibold">
				The founder of Agnel ashram, Fr. C. Rodrigues was a great visionary. His vision was to foster love and understanding among the various
				communities in India and to contribute to the development of self-reliance among the youth through education.
				<br /><br />
				Agnel Polytechnic in Vashi, Navi Mumbai, was started in 1983 with only one program - Diploma in civil engineering. It has grown since then, and
				today we have four branches of study in the polytechnic - Diploma in Civil Engineering, Dip. in Mechanical Engineering, Dip. in Automobile engineering
				and Dip. in Electronics and Telecommunication.
				<br /><br />
				What makes Agnel Polytechnic a unique institution in Mumbai is its discipline and culture and the dedication of the faculty in imparting knowledge
				and expertise to the students in a cosmopolitan atmosphere.
