			<p class="py-6">
				Agnel Polytechnic was established in 1983 by Agnel Ashram Fathers as the first unit of Agnel
				Technical Education Complex. The Complex has grown over the years and has shown marked
				progress in various fields due to the dedicated service and leadership of Rev. Fr. Orlando
				and Rev. Fr. Almeida. Our institute was the first Polytechnic to be accredited in Navi
				Mumbai.
				<br />
				<br />
				Education is that which forms character, strengthens mind, expands the intellect and helps one
				to stand on oneâ€™s feet. A cohesive team of well-qualified, dedicated and sincere staff are committed
				to focused vision of imparting quality education and wholesome growth of students. Most of our
				students pass out with flying colours every year and a good percentage of them enroll for higher
				studies. There are many successful entrepreneurs in various fields from our Alumni. We have a
				Center for Incubation and Business Acceleration(CIBA) which gives support and guidance to our
				young entrepreneurs to transfer their ideas into business.
				<br />
				<br />
				The institute has good infrastructural facilities. All laboratories are well equipped with modern
				instruments/machinery. In order to have effective industry-institute interaction, we have signed
				MOUs with industries, the major one being the tie-up signed with Hyundai Motors India Ltd. (HMIL).
				HMIL has developed an Automobile Lab and Training Center to make sure that the skills imparted
				by the institute keep in pace with the industry and produces quality manpower.
