				Agnel Polytechnic was established in 1983 by Agnel Ashram Fathers as the first unit of Agnel Technical Education Complex. The Complex has
				grown over the years and has shown marked progress in various fields due to the dedicated service and leadership of Rev. Fr. Orlando and Rev.
				Fr. Almeida. Our institute was the first Polytechnic to be accredited in Navi Mumbai.
				<br /><br />
				Education is that which forms character, strengthens mind, expands the intellect and helps one to stand on one's feet. A cohesive team of well-qualified,
				dedicated and sincere staff are committed to focused vision of imparting quality education and wholesome growth of students. Most of our students
				pass out with flying colors every year and a good percentage of them enroll for higher studies. There are many successful entrepreneurs in various
				fields from our Alumni. We have a Center for Incubation and Business Acceleration (CIBA) which gives support and guidance to our young entrepreneurs
				to transfer their ideas into business.
				<br /><br />
				The institute has good infrastructural facilities. All laboratories are well equipped with modern instruments/machinery. In order to have effective
				industry-institute interaction, we have signed MOUs with industries, the major one being the tie-up signed with Hyundai Motors India Ltd. (HMIL).
				HMIL has developed an Automobile Lab and Training Center to make sure that the skills imparted by the institute keep in pace with the industry
				and produces quality manpower.
