				Established Institution’s Innovation Council under ‘MHRD’s Innovation Cell (MIC) to systematically foster the culture of Innovation amongst
				students.
				<br />
				<br />
				The IIC promotes innovation in the Institution through multitudinous modes leading to an innovation promotion eco-system in the campus. Last year
				for the National Innovation Contest a total of 947 PoCs were submitted by IICs all over India including IITs, NITs, Engg Colleges, etc. We are
				glad to announce that the PoC submitted by our students “Early detection of cancer with non-invasive technique” from the Electronics Department
				under the guidance of Mr. Umesh Mhapankar got selected for the National Boot Camp and ours was the only Polytechnic in the selected list.
