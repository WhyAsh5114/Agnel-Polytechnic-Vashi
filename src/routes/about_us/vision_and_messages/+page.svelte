					<p class="py-6">
						Agnel Polytechnic was established in 1983 by Agnel Ashram Fathers as the first unit of
						Agnel Technical Education Complex. The Complex has grown over the years and has shown
						marked progress in various fields due to the dedicated service and leadership of Rev.
						Fr. Orlando and Rev. Fr. Almeida. Our institute was the first Polytechnic to be
						accredited in Navi Mumbai.
						<br />
						<br />
						Education is that which forms character, strengthens mind, expands the intellect and helps
						one to stand on one’s feet. A cohesive team of well-qualified, dedicated and sincere staff
						are committed to focused vision of imparting quality education and wholesome growth of students.
						Most of our students pass out with flying colours every year and a good percentage of them
						enroll for higher studies. There are many successful entrepreneurs in various fields from
						our Alumni. We have a Center for Incubation and Business Acceleration(CIBA) which gives support
						and guidance to our young entrepreneurs to transfer their ideas into business.
						<br />
						<br />
						The institute has good infrastructural facilities. All laboratories are well equipped with
						modern instruments/machinery. In order to have effective industry-institute interaction,
						we have signed MOUs with industries, the major one being the tie-up signed with Hyundai Motors
						India Ltd. (HMIL). HMIL has developed an Automobile Lab and Training Center to make sure
						that the skills imparted by the institute keep in pace with the industry and produces quality
						manpower.
